A few scattered, little utility I've laying around my disks

## Merge PDF

I have a automatic feed scanner that only handle single sided paper.
This little utility allows to combine two files that contains, one the
front pages and one the back pages in reverse order (that's how I scan
my documents).

## Stocks

Process Morgan Stanley vesting documents to extract details and
organize the reports renaming the files.
